Implement null pattern for "message" passing models -
execute the message as it should, but default to a NullMessage on 'error'

Server could be/have:
- Observable
- Command pattern(receiver)

Client could be/have:
- Observable
- Command pattern(sender)

Data provider should be Thread-safe Singleton with lazy loading
